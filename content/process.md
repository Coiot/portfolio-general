## Overview of Services

### Graphic & Web Design

As a graphic designer, I provide print and web-ready material ranging from logos, business cards, posters & banners, icons, illustrations, and more. My work is <mark>vector based</mark> built to scale to any size, or <mark>hand-drawn</mark> to provide a personal touch. As a web designer, my work goes from sketch to finished design including all the <mark>coded styling</mark>. Through setting up the information architecture to working prototype, I do not chase imaginary pixel perfection and work on a strong foundation that ensures the vision translates across devices.

### Web Development

As a web developer, I turn web designs into <mark>responsive, mobile-ready applications</mark> that have custom code on private servers or cloud infrastructure. I build marketing websites with static-site generators and e-commerce web apps as single-page or server-side applications. I provide <abbr title="Don’t Repeat Yourself">DRY</abbr> code that aims for maintainability and markup that is semantic with <mark>accessibility</mark> as a priority. I maintain servers and provide troubleshooting in debugging errors. I can also provide services in setting up <mark>e-commerce</mark> portals through platforms like Shopify.

### Marketing

I run social media campaigns to grow a following and keep <mark>content calendars</mark> busy. I direct a consistent branding strategy that will have the campaign standout from amongst its competition. I setup <mark>newsletters</mark> and create <mark>email</mark> designs—providing templates for future use if my role is temporary. I do research and discovery to make sure our <mark><abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr></mark> strategy reaches the intended demographics and builds upon the <abbr title="Key Performance Indicators">KPIs</abbr> that are identified.

### Other

I can provide for projects new and old <mark>documentation</mark> and <mark>art direction</mark> guides to assist with onboarding and keep knowledge transfer in the organization fast and well articulated. I provide <mark>copywriting</mark> to keep a strong and consistent voice throughout copy and printed materials. I also provide assistance to <mark>video editing</mark>, filming, and <mark>photography</mark>. If needed, I am able to help with hardware setup and repair.
