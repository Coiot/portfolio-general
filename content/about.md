Hello, I am Isaac Volpe, current graduate student at the University of Arkansas in the Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies program. I have been a <mark>graphic design</mark> and <mark>web development</mark> freelancer for over ten years with a focus on the Frontend, with particular proficiency in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.

I began web freelancing as a teenager in 2005 after having a template design being chosen for purchase by then <abbr title="What you see is what you get"> WYSIWYG </abbr> web builder Moonfruit, and at the same time locally being approached to make websites (happens to anyone perceived as a general tech specialist). I had previously made websites for online communities in Flash with Actionscript, but shortly I started to develop a steady stream of clients with <mark>non-profits</mark> and minority businesses, ranging from logo design to computer repair (again for being the approachable *‘expert’*).

I transitioned into making websites from scratch and falling in love with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (yes it happens). I quickly went from using frameworks to building some of my own and mastering preprocessors. I jumped into Wordpress, and learned how to use Twig templating with <mark>Timber</mark> to escape the dreaded Wordpress *’loop’* and build custom themes. After having a small portfolio of recurring clients, the managed hosting fees (extent of my knowledge at the time) lead me to start running servers of my own through <mark>DigitalOcean</mark>. Overtime I reduced much of my overhead and learned a lot from many mistakes along the way.

Capable of being a one-man studio, I was always looking to see how I can make things more accessible, faster, and cost-effective. I made the transition from jQuery to using Vanilla Javascript as I became an adopter of <mark>JAMstack architecture</mark>. I was familiar with doing Backend work, DevOps to run my own servers, and now the transition to using web based <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> relational databases for my clients really sped up and improved my setup through <mark>Netlify</mark> and <mark>KeyCDN</mark>.

I became fond of <mark>Vue</mark> because I could still write <mark><abbr title="Sassy Cascading Style Sheets">SCSS</abbr></mark> and markup as I always had but now in single file components that still obeyed a cascade to keep things ordered without bloating up my projects. Though as much as I love Vue, and use it for UI with little additional node dependencies, I also began to learn how to use <mark>Hugo</mark> to have the best possible performance and no reliance on Javascript. In this way, I found the right balance for me, Hugo for static websites, Vue for web apps, and <mark>Nuxt + Laravel</mark> for server-side projects.

Despite being able to communicate across disciplines and have working knowledge across the production pipeline, I do not wish to give the impression I am a Fullstack developer—I very much label myself as a <mark>Frontend developer</mark> and <mark>visual designer</mark>. I’m at home working with vectors and UI. I have an academic side, but to be honest I can hardly escape doing web dev so I’m always looking new projects and to have my next design be my best yet.

*Thanks for reading this far!* Hope you learned a little about me. Always [available to chat](mailto:contact@isaacvolpe.com) if you want to know more details, or see how my experience will work for you.
