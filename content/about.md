Hello, I am Isaac Volpe, current graduate student at the University of Arkansas in the Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies program. I have been a <mark>graphic design</mark>, <mark>web design</mark>, and <mark>web development</mark> freelancer for over ten years with a focus on the Frontend, with particular proficiency in CSS and Design.

Two years ago I made the transition from jQuery to using Vanilla Javascript and Vue and I have familiarity with PHP from when I would primarily be creating Wordpress websites before being an early adopter and promoter of JAMstack architecture. IÊ¼m also familiar with doing Backend work, DevOps to run my own virtual servers, and have been transitioning to using web based API relational databases for my projects and clients; although, despite being able to communicate across multiple disciplines and have working knowledge across the production pipeline for web projects, I do not wish to give the impression I am a Fullstack developer, I very much label myself as a Frontender and visual designer.

*Fast-learner* who has spent over a decade improving upon a diverse technical skillset while still pursuing an academic career. Logical thinker who plans well-ahead and articulates strategy with team members. Capable of being a one-man studio who takes charge with responsibilities and understands value of improving upon mistakes.

_Thank You for reading!_
